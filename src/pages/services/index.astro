const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is managed WordPress hosting?",
    answer: "Managed WordPress hosting is a premium hosting service where we handle all technical aspects of running your WordPress site — updates, security, backups, performance, and support. Unlike DIY hosting, you get a team of WordPress experts maintaining your site 24/7."
  },
  {
    question: "How is SparkHost different from other WordPress hosts?",
    answer: "We're 100% Irish-owned with local support (WhatsApp, email, phone), EU data centres for GDPR compliance, and all-inclusive pricing. No upsells, no hidden fees. We also include services like malware removal and hack recovery that others charge extra for."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need all 7 services?",
    answer: "All 7 services are included with every plan — you don't pick and choose. This ensures comprehensive protection. The difference between Standard (€40/mo) and Managed (€249/mo) is in storage, staging environments, support priority, and included content change hours."
  },
  {
    question: "Will you migrate my existing WordPress site?",
    answer: "Yes! Free migration is included with all plans. We handle the full transfer — files, database, emails, and DNS — with minimal downtime. Most migrations complete within 24-48 hours."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my site gets hacked?",
    answer: "Hack recovery is included. We'll clean the malware, identify how it happened, patch vulnerabilities, and restore your site. For Managed plans, we also provide a post-incident security audit."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you host WooCommerce sites?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our hosting is optimised for WooCommerce with e-commerce specific caching, secure payment processing, and experience handling high-traffic sales events. See our WooCommerce Hosting page for details."
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in 'content change hours'?",
    answer: "Content changes are small website updates we do for you — updating text, swapping images, adding blog posts, minor layout tweaks. Standard includes 1 hour/month, Managed includes 3 hours/month. Unused hours don't roll over, but you can request additional hours at €60/hr."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You can upgrade instantly (we'll pro-rate your billing) or downgrade at the end of your billing cycle. No lock-in contracts — cancel anytime with 30 days notice."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer email hosting?",
    answer: "We focus on WordPress hosting and recommend using a dedicated email service like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 for business email. We'll help configure your DNS records to work with any email provider."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed my storage limit?",
    answer: "We'll notify you before you hit the limit. You can upgrade your plan, or we can help optimise your site (compress images, clean up old backups, etc.). We never suspend sites without warning."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a setup fee?",
    answer: "No setup fees, ever. You pay your first month's hosting and we handle the migration free of charge. What you see is what you pay."
  },
  {
    question: "What WordPress plugins do you support?",
    answer: "We support virtually all plugins, with some security exceptions (we block vulnerable or malicious plugins). We have experience with WooCommerce, Elementor, ACF, Gravity Forms, WPML, and hundreds more. If you're unsure about a specific plugin, just ask."
