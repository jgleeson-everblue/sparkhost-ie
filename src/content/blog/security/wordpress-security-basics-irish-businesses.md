Your WordPress website is one of your most important business assets. Yet many Irish businesses leave their sites vulnerable to attacks that are entirely preventable.

Here's what you need to know to keep your site secure — explained in plain English.

## Why WordPress Sites Get Hacked

Let's be clear: WordPress itself is secure. The problems come from:

- **Outdated software** — Old versions of WordPress, themes, and plugins contain known vulnerabilities
- **Weak passwords** — "admin123" is not a password, it's an invitation
- **Dodgy plugins** — Free plugins from untrusted sources often contain malicious code
- **Cheap hosting** — Shared hosting with hundreds of sites on one server means one compromised site can affect yours

## The Essential Security Checklist

### 1. Keep Everything Updated

WordPress, your theme, and all plugins should be running the latest versions. Updates fix security holes. Delaying updates is like leaving your shop door unlocked overnight. Learn more in our guide to [why WordPress updates matter](/blog/wordpress-updates-why-matter).

**The catch:** Updates can sometimes break things. That's why we test all updates on a [staging environment](/blog/wordpress-staging-sites) before applying them to live sites.

### 2. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Every account on your WordPress site should have a strong, unique password. Use a password manager like 1Password or Bitwarden. Never reuse passwords across sites.

### 3. Limit Login Attempts

Hackers use automated tools that try thousands of password combinations. Limiting login attempts blocks these "[brute force attacks](/blog/brute-force-attacks-prevention)". Most security plugins include this feature. For even stronger protection, consider adding [two-factor authentication](/blog/two-factor-authentication-wordpress).

### 4. Install a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A [WAF filters malicious traffic](/blog/wordpress-firewall-guide) before it reaches your site. Cloudflare (free tier) provides basic protection. For serious protection, we use Patchstack which blocks WordPress-specific attacks.

### 5. Back Up Everything

If the worst happens, a recent backup is your get-out-of-jail-free card. Daily backups with at least 7 days retention. Store backups off-site (not on your web server). Read our complete guide to [WordPress backup strategy](/blog/wordpress-backup-strategy).

## Signs Your Site May Be Compromised

Watch for these warning signs:

- Strange admin users you didn't create
- Unfamiliar files in your WordPress directories
- Your site redirecting to spam sites
- Google warning visitors that your site is unsafe
- Sudden spike in outgoing emails (your server being used for spam)

If you think your site has been compromised, follow our step-by-step [malware removal guide](/blog/wordpress-malware-removal-guide).

## What We Do at SparkHost

- Automatic WordPress, theme, and plugin updates (tested first)

## The Bottom Line

WordPress security isn't complicated, but it does require consistent attention. The basics — updates, strong passwords, backups — prevent 95% of attacks.

For Irish businesses, the question isn't whether to invest in security, but whether to handle it yourself or let professionals manage it. Given the average cost of recovering from a hack (€10,000+ for SMEs), [professional WordPress maintenance](/services/wordpress-maintenance) is good economics.
